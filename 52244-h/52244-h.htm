<h2>I. SCOPE OF THIS PAMPHLET.</h2>


<p>The Committee on Railway Mail Pay, representing railways whose
lines include ninety-two per cent. of the aggregate length of all railway
mail routes in the United States, believes that the payments to the railways
for the services and facilities furnished by them to the Post Office
Department are, and for a long time have been, unjustly low. This
pamphlet contains a concise statement of the facts which prove that this
belief is warranted and, incidentally, a refutation of the estimates made
by the Postmaster-General, and reported to the Congress (House Document
No. 105, Sixty-second Congress, first session), which led him to
conclude that the basis of payment could now properly be changed so
as to accomplish a present reduction of about twenty per cent. It will
be shown that although the insufficient data and the erroneous methods
employed by the Postmaster-General resulted in his making estimates of
cost to the railways that are far below the real cost, his own figures and
calculations, when properly analyzed and supplemented, demonstrate that
the mail service has not been fairly remunerative to the railways.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to this demonstration it should, however, be noted
that&mdash;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>II. RAILWAY MAIL PAY IS ABOUT TO BE FORCED
STILL FURTHER BELOW THE LEVEL OF JUST COMPENSATION,
UNLESS PAYMENTS ARE PROMPTLY READJUSTED,
ON ACCOUNT OF THE ADDITIONAL VOLUME OF MAIL
THAT WILL RESULT FROM THE INAUGURATION, ON JANUARY
1, 1913, OF THE PARCELS POST.</h2>

<p>Congress has provided for a vast and incalculable extension of mail
traffic by creating a "Parcels Post," to be inaugurated on January 1,
1913, which, by opening the mails to many articles not previously accepted
at the post-offices and by materially reducing the rates on mailed
merchandise, is expected enormously to increase the volume of the shipments
which it covers. The Government seems to have assumed that,
under existing contracts, which were made before the meaning of the
word "mail" was thus extended, the railways can be compelled, until
these contracts expire, to carry this great additional volume of mail
traffic WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION WHATEVER. If the
former practice of the Post Office Department is followed, no new contracts
will be made until after the next quadrennial weighings in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of the four weighing sections, so that the position of the Government
amounts to an assertion that the whole added volume of the Parcels Post
mails will have to be carried without any compensation by the railways
of New England for four years and six months (these railways are in
the first weighing section but the weighing for the adjustment to be
made on July 1, 1913, has begun and will be completed before the
Parcels Post is inaugurated), by those of the second weighing section for
three years and six months, by those of the third weighing section for
two years and six months, by those of the fourth weighing section for
one year and six months, and by those of the first weighing section, not
located in New England, for six months. No presentation of the injustice
of the mail pay received in former years suggests even the approximate
extent of the losses which the railways will thus incur in the
next four and one-half years, unless readjustments are promptly made
on account of the Parcels Post.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>III. THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S ERRONEOUS ASSERTION
THAT THE RAILWAYS WERE OVERPAID "ABOUT
$9,000,000.00" IN THE YEAR 1909, RESTS PRIMARILY UPON
HIS ADOPTING AN UNPRECEDENTED THEORY WHICH ALLOWS
NOTHING FOR A RETURN UPON THE CAPITAL INVESTED
IN RAILWAY PROPERTY.</h2>


<p>The Postmaster-General assumed that the railways would be properly
compensated if they received a sum equal to the operating expenses
and taxes attributable to the carriage of the mails plus six per cent. of
the sum of those expenses and taxes. The calculation by which he obtained
the sum which he assumed would have been proper compensation
for the single month covered by his investigation was as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Proper compensation">
<tr><td align="left">His estimate of operating expenses and taxes on account of mail service (Document No. 105, p. 280) for one month</td>
    <td align="right">$2,676,503.75</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Six per cent. of above</td>
    <td align="right">160,590.22</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td align="right">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Total, assumed to represent just compensation for one month</td>
    <td align="right">$2,837,093.97</td></tr>
</table></div>
<p>The railways having been paid, for the month selected, $770,679.16
in excess of the sum resulting from the above calculation, the Postmaster-General
assumed that this excess over expenses and taxes plus six
per cent. constituted excessive profit for that month. He multiplied this
assumed excess by twelve to get his estimate of annual excess and stated
the result, in round figures, as "about $9,000,000."</p>

<p>The mere statement of this method discloses the fact that it makes
no allowance for any return upon the fair value of the railway property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
employed in the service of the public. This omission is, of itself, sufficient
wholly to destroy the Postmaster-General's conclusion. Everyone
recognizes that a railway is entitled to at least a reasonable return upon
the value of its property devoted to the public service. The Postmaster-General
ignored this universally accepted principle and adopted a theory
which, if applied to the general business of the companies, would render
substantially every mile of railway in the United States immediately and
hopelessly bankrupt. The recently published report of the Interstate
Commerce Commission on the railway statistics of the year that ended
with June 30, 1910, contains data by which this statement is easily
demonstrated, as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Railway statistics">
<tr><td align="left">Operating expenses of all United States railways, for the year</td>
    <td align="right">$1,822,630,433</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Taxes of all United States railways, for the year</td>
    <td align="right">103,795,701</td></tr>
<tr><td></td>
    <td align="right">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Total</td>
    <td align="right">$1,926,426,134</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Six per cent. of above total</td>
    <td align="right">115,585,568</td></tr>
<tr><td></td>
    <td align="right">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Total gross receipts permitted by Postmaster-General's plan</td>
    <td align="right">$2,042,011,702</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>But if this plan had been in force, the railways would have had, for
interest on mortgage bonds, a reasonable surplus as a margin of safety,
dividends on stocks, unprofitable but necessary permanent improvements,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
rents of leased properties, etc., etc., only the six per cent. or
$115,585,568. This figure may be compared with the following, among
others:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Comparison figures">
<tr><td align="left">Interest obligations (on funded debt only) of all United States railways, for the same year</td>
    <td align="right">$370,092,222</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Rentals of leased properties, all United States railways, for the same year</td>
    <td align="right">$133,881,409</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Plainly, the Postmaster-General's proposal is equivalent to an assertion
that the railways would make a fair profit if they were enabled to
collect the sum of $115,585,568 in addition to their operating expenses
and taxes, but the figures given by the Interstate Commerce Commission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
show that this would be less than one-third of the sum necessary to meet
interest charges which must be paid in order to prevent foreclosures of
mortgages and, if bond interest could be ignored, is much less than the
rentals that must be paid if the existing systems are not to be broken
up. And, of course, it would allow nothing whatever for legitimate
demands upon income for dividends, permanent improvements or surplus.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to dwell upon the consequences of such a theory
of "compensation" to railroad credit and to the public interest in efficient
transportation service, to say nothing of the consequences to owners
of railroad stock and bonds. Such a theory is not a theory of compensation&mdash;it
is a theory of oppression and of destruction.</p>

<p>The fact that the Postmaster-General has found it necessary to
justify his attack upon the present basis of railway mail pay by a theory
so unprecedented and so unwarranted in principle and in law, raises a
strong presumption against all his opinions and conclusions upon this
subject.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>IV. THE MAIL SERVICE SUPPLIED BY THE RAILWAYS
COSTS THEM MORE IN OPERATING EXPENSES AND TAXES
THAN THEY ARE PAID FOR IT, AND LEAVES NOTHING FOR
RETURN ON THE PROPERTY.</h2>


<p>It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the railway mail pay at
present is insufficient to pay even its proper share of operating cost and
taxes and does not produce any return upon the property. This will
be demonstrated by any fair inquiry, as will now be shown. Reports
submitted to the Postmaster-General by railways operating 2,411 mail
routes, with a total length of 178,710 miles, showed that their gross
receipts, per car-foot mile<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>, from services rendered on passenger trains
during November, 1909, were as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Gross receipts">
<tr><td align="left">From mail</td>
    <td align="right">3.23 mills</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">From other services</td>
    <td align="right">4.35 mills</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Thus it appears that the space on passenger trains required for the
mails is proportionately less than three-quarters as productive as that
devoted to passengers, express, milk, excess baggage, etc., etc. As it is
the general belief of railway managers, whose conclusion in this respect
has rarely if ever been challenged, that the passenger train services, as
a whole, do not produce revenues sufficient to meet their fair proportion
of the operating costs and the necessary return upon investment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
therefore are not reasonably compensatory, it is evident that the mail
service, the pay for which is more than twenty-five per cent. below the
average for the other services rendered on the same trains, must bring in
much less than reasonable compensation. Certainly railroad revenues
as a whole could not be reduced twenty-five per cent. without destroying
all return upon the property. If so, it must be true that there can be
no compensation in a rate of mail pay that is twenty-five per cent. less
than the rate of pay for passenger traffic which, as above shown, is relatively
unprofitable.</p>

<p>No merely statistical comparison can, however, reveal the whole
story for the railways are required to furnish many incidental facilities
and to perform many additional services for the Post Office Department,
which render the mail service exceptionally arduous and costly. These
extra services include calling for and delivering mails at a large proportion
of the post offices located at railway towns; supplying rooms, with
light, heat and water, in railway stations for the use of the mail clerks;
placing cars, duly lighted and heated, on station tracks for advance
distribution, often many hours before the departure of trains; carrying
officers and agents of the Post Office Department as passengers but without
compensation to the extent of more than 50,000,000 passenger miles
annually (this being, of course, in addition to the railway mail clerks on
duty), etc., etc. Extracts from the "Postal Laws and Regulations" defining
and demanding these services are given in <a href="#Page_23">Appendix A</a>. No one can
examine this appendix and not be convinced that the mail service is the
most exacting among all those rendered by American railways.</p>

<p>The fairness of railway mail pay can also be tested by apportioning
operating expenses between passenger and freight traffic, and then making
a secondary apportionment of the passenger expenses between mail
and other kinds of traffic carried on passenger trains. This method involves
charging directly to each kind of traffic all expenses pertaining
exclusively thereto, and the apportionment, on some fair basis, of those
expenses which are common to more than one kind of traffic.</p>

<p>In accordance with the request of the Postmaster-General, the
railways estimated the cost of conducting the mail service in the manner
just explained and reported the results to the Postmaster-General. After
first charging to each service the expenses wholly due to it they apportioned
the common expenses between the passenger and freight services,
following (with inconsequential exceptions) the method most generally
employed for that purpose, namely the apportionment of these expenses
in the proportions of the revenue train mileage of each service. Having
estimated, in this way, the operating expenses attributable to passenger
trains, the railways assigned to the mails the portion of this aggregate
indicated by the proportion of the total passenger train space required<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
for the mails. Using this method, 186 railways, operating 2,370 mail
routes, with a total length of 176,716 miles, ascertained and reported
that for November, 1909, the operating expenses (not including taxes),
for conducting the mail service were $4,009,184. The Postmaster-General
states (Document No. 105, page 281), that all the railways represented
in the foregoing, and enough others to increase the mileage represented
to 194,978 miles, were paid for the same month only $3,607,773.13.
It thus appears that the pay was far below the operating expenses,
without making any allowance for taxes or for a return upon the
fair value of the property employed.</p>

<p>While different methods are in use for ascertaining the cost of
passenger train service and the results produced by such methods may
show considerable variation, yet the mail pay is so far below reasonable
compensation, from the standpoint of the cost of the service and a return
upon the value of the property, that no method can be reasonably urged
which would not demonstrate the non-compensatory character of the
present mail pay. This is illustrated by the method which the Postmaster-General
himself employed, as the character of that method is such
that it necessarily produces the very lowest estimate of cost for the
passenger train service.</p>

</table></div>

<p>Thus even the Postmaster-General's method of apportioning costs
between freight and passenger traffic produces an operating cost in excess
of the total pay received by the railways, leaving nothing whatever for
return upon the fair value of the property or necessary but non-income
producing improvements.</p>

<p>There is no allowance, in any of these estimates of cost, for the large
volume of free transportation supplied to officers and agents of the Post
Office Department, when not in charge of mail, although this amounts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
over 50,000,000 passenger miles annually and, at the low average rate of
two cents per mile, would cost the Post Office Department more than
$1,000,000 per year.</p>

<p>Moreover, as will presently be shown (pages 13-14) all the figures
here discussed are for the month of November, a month which, because
of the abnormally low ratio of passenger traffic to freight traffic, substantially
understates the cost of the passenger train services, when figures
derived from it are applied to an entire year.</p>

<p>It thus becomes evident that any inquiry which takes into consideration
the necessary elements of the situation will demonstrate that railway
mail pay is too low. It is only by ignoring essential elements of
the service and of expense and the fundamental element of a return on
the value of the property that any argument to the contrary can be
constructed.</p>

<p>Thus the mail traffic does not pay its operating cost. That traffic
is a substantial percentage of the total public service performed by the
railroads. It should contribute a substantial proportion to the taxes
which the railroads have to pay and to the return on railroad property
which its owners are entitled to receive. Clearly no fair method can be
devised which will fail to show that the existing mail pay is far below
a fairly compensatory basis. Certainly this condition ought not to be
intensified by adding the injustice of still further reductions. On the
contrary, the unjust reductions of recent years should be corrected for
the future, and the railroads should be relieved from the strikingly
unjust methods by which they are at present deprived of anything approaching
fair compensation.</p>

<h2>V. THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S APPORTIONMENT
OF SPACE BETWEEN THE MAIL SERVICE AND THE OTHER
SERVICES RENDERED ON PASSENGER TRAINS DID NOT
ALLOW TO THE MAILS THE SPACE WHICH THEY ACTUALLY
REQUIRE AND USE AND THIS HAD THE RESULT OF
UNDULY REDUCING HIS ESTIMATES OF THE COST TO THE
RAILWAYS OF THE MAIL SERVICE.</h2>


<p>Detailed reference will now be made to the methods and controlling
effect of the Postmaster-General's apportionment of passenger train
space between the mails and the other services rendered on passenger
trains. Such an apportionment was a necessary step in the calculations
reported in Document No. 105. Having obtained certain estimates of
the cost of the passenger train services, considered together, by methods,
producing the lowest results, the next step shown in Document No. 105
was to apportion a part of this cost to the mail service. The accepted
method for such an apportionment is to distribute the total cost in proportion
to the train space required by each of the respective services.
The Postmaster-General obtained from the railways statements which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
he might have used in applying this method and these statements showed
that 9.32 per cent. of the total space in passenger trains was required by
the mails, but, instead of using the data showing this fact, he substituted
figures of his own which reduced the space credited to the mail service
to 7.16 per cent. of the total. The total of passenger train costs which
the Postmaster-General estimated should be apportioned among passengers,
express and mail, on the basis of space occupied, was
$37,074,172.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> He therefore assigned to the mail service 7.16 per cent. of
the last-named sum or $2,654,510.69. If, however, he had used the
proportion of space, 9.32 per cent., resulting from the reports he had
obtained from the railways, the amount apportioned as cost of the mail
service for the month would have been $800,802 greater. Multiplying
this by twelve gives an increase in the estimated annual cost of over
$9,600,000.</p>

<p>Thus the Postmaster-General arrived at his declaration that the
railways were getting an excess profit of $9,000,000 by means of two
fundamental errors, omitting for the present reference to any other
errors. He understated the annual mail expenses and taxes of the railways
by at least $9,600,000, and he ignored entirely the necessary return
on the value of railroad property.</p>

<p>This examination of his methods shows that the determination of
space was of primary and controlling importance and that the changes in
space allotment have destroyed the value of his deductions. These
changes were due to his refusal to assign to the mail service the working
space and temporarily unoccupied space on trains, which were necessary
to the mail service and to his actually assigning much of this space to
the passenger service rendered on the same trains.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to note that all kinds of traffic require
"working space" in addition to the space actually occupied by the traffic
itself, and that this is especially true of the mail traffic, or that where
there is a preponderating movement of a certain traffic in one direction
there must be some empty space on account of that traffic, sometimes
called "dead" space, in trains moving in the direction of lighter traffic.
Thus passenger cars must have aisles, vestibules and platforms, and
postal cars must have a great deal of space in which to sort the mails
while, for mail carried in baggage cars, there must be space in which
to reach the pouches and to receive and deliver them through the doors.
A through train must also have the full capacity required for the
max<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>imum traffic of any kind likely to seek accommodation on any part of its
journey, although during much of each trip the actual traffic may be
considerably below this limit. The Postmaster-General, however, refused
to credit the mail service with much of the space thus required by the
Department although his figures for the other passenger train services
allowed fully for all such space required by them. In fact in many cases
such space, actually required by the mails and so reported by the railways,
was taken from the total mail space and, without reason, assigned to
the passenger service. These modifications of the data correctly reported,
not susceptible of justification upon any sound transportation principle,
were carried so far that the tabulations of the Post Office Department,
which are stated for railway mail routes having a total length of
194,977.55 miles<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> show only 926,164,459 "car-foot miles" made in the
mail service, although certain railways, included therein, and having
railway mail routes aggregating only 178,709.96 miles, had correctly
reported mail space equivalent to 1,153,110,245 "car-foot miles." Thus,
although the Department's figures cover 8.3 per cent. more mileage, its
reductions of space resulted in assigning to this greater mileage about
one-quarter (24.5 per cent.) less mail space. At the same time the Department
actually increased the space assigned to the other passenger
train services, its figures showing 12,014,065,506 car-foot miles in these
services for 194,977.55 miles of mail routes which must be compared
with 11,222,478,739 car-foot miles reported by the railways for
178,709.96 mail-route miles.</p>

<p>This treatment of the controlling figures as to space, supplementing
the other errors of method and omissions of fact, which have been or
will be cited, was amply sufficient to turn a real loss into an apparent
profit.</p>

<h2>VI. THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL IGNORED DATA
WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED SHOWING EXPENDITURES ON
ACCOUNT OF THE MAILS LARGELY IN EXCESS OF THE
DIRECT EXPENSES FOR THAT SERVICE WHICH HE REPORTED.</h2>


<p>As a part of the investigation reported in Document No. 105 the
Postmaster-General obtained from the railways statements showing the
amounts expended by them for the station and terminal services required
by his Department and the amount of free transportation furnished on
his requisition for officers and agents of the postal service when not in
charge of mail. These data were not used (Document No. 105, p. 6)
and, as no adequate allowance was made in any other way for these expenses,
the omission unjustly reduced the estimates of the cost to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
railways of their postal services. The Postmaster-General's explanation
of this omission implies that it was partially offset by the assignment as
cost of mail service of its proportion, on the space basis, of all the station
and terminal expenses of the passenger train services but these special
mail expenses are disproportionately heavy and the amount so assigned
was far too low. The expenses for station and terminal services especially
incurred for the mails, during November, 1909, and reported to
the Postmaster-General, for ninety-two per cent. of the mileage covered
by Document No. 105 aggregated $401,136.00, as follows:</p>

<p>All the foregoing data were reported to the Postmaster-General in
response to his request but he made no use of these items, an omission
manifestly to the serious disadvantage of the railways and having the
effect of unduly reducing his estimates of the cost of the mail service.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Postmaster-General omitted to use the data he had
obtained from the railways showing the volume of free passenger transportation,
already referred to, supplied to the officers and agents of the
Post Office Department and his estimates contain no recognition of the
cost of this service although its extent should be a matter of record in
the Department as it is furnished only on its requisition. The space<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
in passenger coaches occupied by these representatives of the Post Office
Department, traveling free, was not assigned to the mail service but was
treated as passenger space.</p>

<h2>VII. THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER IS NOT A FAIR
AVERAGE MONTH IN ANY RAILWAY YEAR OR ONE THAT
IS TYPICAL OF A YEAR'S BUSINESS AND ITS USE AS THE
SOLE BASIS OF THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S CALCULATIONS
WAS SO UNFAVORABLE TO THE RAILWAYS AS TO
DEPRIVE THE RESULTS OF ANY VALUE EVEN IF IN ALL
OTHER RESPECTS HIS METHODS WERE BEYOND CRITICISM.</h2>


<p>All the Postmaster-General's calculations, reported in Document
No. 105, and by him relied upon therein, and elsewhere, to substantiate
his attack upon existing railway mail pay, depend solely upon data for
the single month of November, in the year 1909. It is obvious, therefore,
that the validity of his conclusions, if all the rest of his processes were
accurate and his deductions otherwise sound, would depend upon whether
November is sufficiently typical of the railway year to be safely used as
the sole basis for conclusions applicable to a whole year. The truth is,
however, that November is not a typical or average month and that all
of its deviations from the averages of the year are such as greatly to
favor the result which the Postmaster-General was seeking.</p>

<p>It may well be doubted whether the railway year contains any
month that can properly be regarded as typical of the whole period but
if it does, the month of November, with four Sundays, two holidays and
only twenty-four working days, is certainly not such a month. The
Interstate Commerce Commission publishes the monthly aggregates of
railway receipts and these official data conclusively prove that November,
1909, was the one month for which the data were most strongly
favorable to finding, by the Postmaster-General's method, an abnormally
low apparent cost for the passenger train services and, consequently, for
the mail service.</p>

<p>It is a month in which substantially Winter conditions prevail in
a large part of the country and, on this account, one during which much
of the ordinary work of maintenance of way and structures must be
suspended. Such work occasions a large fraction of the yearly expenses of
all railways and these expenses pertain in a relatively large proportion to
the passenger services because the higher speed of passenger trains results
in greater relative wear and tear upon road-bed and structures than that
caused by the slower trains of the freight service and the requirements
of safety to passengers carried at high speed impose more costly standards
of maintenance than would otherwise be necessary. Consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
a month in which these maintenance expenses are necessarily below
the yearly average cannot typify the full annual cost of the passenger
train services. Figures showing the facts are contained in <a href="#Page_27">Appendix B</a>.</p>

<p>It is, of course, understood that the respective expenses of the passenger
and freight services must move upward and downward with the
fluctuations in the volume of each sort of traffic. No month can furnish
a reliable basis for estimating the proportion of the total expenses that
is caused by the passenger service unless during that month the volume
of passenger traffic bears a normal relation to the volume of freight
traffic. But in November, 1909, as will appear from official figures for
each month in the year contained in <a href="#Page_28">Appendix C</a>, passenger traffic, as
measured by receipts therefrom, was much below the average month of
the year while freight traffic was far above the average. The November
receipts from passengers amounted to only 21.5 per cent. of total receipts,
the lowest relation shown for any month in the year. Of course, under
these conditions passenger expenses were curtailed and freight expenses
relatively enhanced. Certainly the use of data resulting from these abnormal
relations could not possibly produce results fairly typical of a
normal period, that is of a whole year. The results so obtained must
have diminished the apparent cost of the passenger train services below
the true cost, by just as much as the figures for November were below
the average figures of the year.</p>

<p>These considerations fully establish the truth that, if every other
feature of Document No. 105 were absolutely beyond criticism, the fact
that it rests wholly upon estimates based upon data for the single month
of November would render its conclusions illusory, misleading and seriously
prejudicial to the railways.</p>

<h2>VIII. A COMMISSION OF SENATORS AND MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS WHICH, BETWEEN 1898 AND 1901, MOST
FULLY AND CAREFULLY INVESTIGATED THE SUBJECT,
ASCERTAINED AND DECLARED THAT RAILWAY MAIL PAY
WAS NOT THEN EXCESSIVE; SINCE THEN THERE HAVE
BEEN MANY AND EXTENSIVE REDUCTIONS IN PAY ACCOMPANIED
BY SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST
AND VALUE OF THE SERVICES RENDERED BY THE RAILWAYS.</h2>


<p>The Congressional Joint Commission to Investigate the Postal Service,
which reported on January 14, 1901, is authority for the fact that, at
that time, railway mail pay was not excessive. Senator William B.
Allison, of Iowa; Senator Edward S. Wolcott, of Colorado; Senator
Thomas S. Martin, of Virginia; Representative Eugene F. Loud, of California;
Representative W. H. Moody, of Massachusetts, and Represen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>tative
T. C. Catchings, of Mississippi, six of the eight members of the
Commission, then united in the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Upon a careful consideration of all the evidence and
the statements and arguments submitted, and in view of
all the services rendered by the railways, we are of the
opinion that 'the prices now paid to the railroad companies
for the transportation of the mails' are not excessive,
and recommend that no reduction thereof be made
at this time." Fifty-second Congress, Second Session,
Senate Document No. 89, pp. 19, 22, 25, 29.</p></blockquote>

<p>Since the Commission reported, the volume of the American mails,
the revenue of the American postal service and its demands upon the
railways for services and facilities have greatly increased. The costs of
supplying railway transportation have also greatly increased. The necessary
cost of railway property per unit of service has increased, and in
consequence the amount required as a reasonable return thereon, on
account of higher wages and prices, the higher standards of service
demanded and the higher value of the real estate required for extended
and necessary terminal plants. Operating expenses have grown by
reason of repeated advances in rates of wages paid to employees of every
grade and increased prices of materials and supplies. Taxes have increased
with the rapidly augmenting exactions of State and local governments
and the imposition of an entirely new Federal corporation tax.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>
Yet during this period of rapidly advancing railway expenses, and in
spite of the fact that at its commencement the railway mail pay was not
excessive, the rates of payment for railway mail services have been subjected
to repeated and drastic decreases accomplished both by legislative
action and by administrative orders. These reductions have so much
more than offset the rather doubtful advantages which the railways
might be assumed to have obtained from the increased volume of mail
traffic that in 1912 they find their mail service more unprofitable than
ever before. The following table shows the facts:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Railway Figures">

    <td>Total railway mail pay</td>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>The foregoing shows that the Post Office Department expended for
railway transportation, in 1901, $34.18 in order to earn $100.00 in gross
and that by 1911 this expenditure had been reduced 37.8 per cent. to
$21.26.</p>

<p>This notable reduction was the consequence (first) of the operation
of the law fixing mail pay under which the average payment per unit of
service decreases as the volume of mail increases; (second) of the Acts
of Congress of March 2, 1907, and May 12, 1910, and (third) of administrative
changes effected by the Post Office Department which, without
decreasing the services required of the railways or enabling those services
to be rendered at any lower cost, greatly reduced the payment therefor.
Chief among these administrative changes was the Postmaster-General's
order known as the "Divisor" order (No. 412 of June 7, 1907, superseding
Order No. 165 of March 2, 1907) radically lowering the basis
for calculating the annual payments for transportation. No official
estimate of the reduction in the aggregate annual payment produced
by the operation of the law fixing the scheme of payment has been made
but from time to time the Department has published estimates of the
reductions otherwise effected. None of these estimates is now up to date,
and to make them comparable with the present volume of mail substantial
increases would be necessary, but they are given below as representing
an amount substantially less than the lowest possible statement
of the total present annual reduction.</p>

<p>No one will contend for a moment that there has been any net
reduction in the cost of supplying railway mail services and facilities
since 1901, the year in which the report of the Joint Commission to
Investigate the Postal Service was made. In fact, all changes in railway
operating costs, except those due to increased efficiency of organization
and management, which can have little if any effect in connection with
mail traffic, have been in the opposite direction. During the years characterized
by these reductions the railways have been called upon continually
to improve the character of their postal service and the Post Office
Department will not deny that the railways are now rendering better,
more frequent, and more expeditious postal service than in 1901, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
any intermediate year, and are doing so at greatly increased cost to themselves.</p>

<p>In view of these thoroughly substantiated facts the drastic reductions
of recent years afford unanswerable proof that railway mail pay
is now too low.</p>

</table></div>

<p>This table shows that in the ten years from 1901 to 1911 the Post
Office Department reduced its operating ratio between its total expenses
and its gross receipts from 103.5 per cent. to 100.3 per cent., being a
reduction of 3.2 points; but it also shows that this improvement was
due solely to the fact that the ratio of railway mail pay expenses to gross
receipts was reduced from 34.2 per cent. to 21.3 per cent., a reduction
of 12.9 points, while the ratio of all other expenses to gross receipts
increased from 69.3 per cent. to 79 per cent., an increase of 9.7 points.
Thus the improvement of 3.2 points in the ratio for all expenses was due
entirely to the greatly reduced ratio of railway mail pay, the heavy reduction
in that respect exceeding by 3.2 points the very substantial
increase in the ratio of all other expenses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>During the ten years from 1901 to 1911 the Department took up
an enormous increase in business at a greatly decreased cost for railway
transportation and at a largely increased cost for other purposes. It
cost the Department, for purposes other than railway transportation,
nearly nine-tenths of $126,248,630 to add that amount to its gross receipts
(although for these other purposes it had previously spent less
than seven-tenths of its gross receipts) while it required less than one-tenth
of the same sum to pay for the added railway transportation that
the new business required (although at the beginning of the period
railway transportation had cost more than one-third of the gross receipts).
This startling comparison fully warrants the conclusion that
the power of Congress and the Department has been exercised to force
upon the railways, by reducing the payments for their services, the
burden not only of the effort to eliminate the annual postal deficit but
of considerable increases in other forms of postal expenditure. No reference
to rural free delivery will serve to explain away the conclusion
suggested by this comparison especially since only a fraction of the cost
of that service represents really an additional net outlay. This service
has permitted a reduction of one-third in the number of post offices and
has been in many cases substituted for star route service and the savings
thus permitted ought to be credited to it before determining its cost.</p>

<p>That increases in postal expenditures were necessary, between 1901
and 1911, is not denied. The period was one in which steady and extensive
increases in the cost of living made necessary considerable increases
in the salaries of postal employees and in the cost of postal supplies,
precisely as the railways were impelled to increase the salaries and wages
of their employees and were obliged to pay higher prices for their supplies.
In other words, the purchasing power of the American dollar,
and of standard money everywhere, greatly decreased and this decrease
affected the Post Office Department as it has affected every business
undertaking. But the purchasing power of the railway dollar decreased
exactly as that of all other dollars and it was unreasonable and unjust
that while this change was in progress, the losses which it entailed in
the postal service of the Government should be shifted, as it has been
shown that they were, to the railways which were, at the same time,
suffering far greater losses from the same cause.</p>

<h2>X. THE CONTINUOUS REFUSAL OF THE POST OFFICE
DEPARTMENT TO ORDER REWEIGHINGS OF THE MAILS
EXCEPT AFTER THE MAXIMUM INTERVAL OF FOUR
YEARS WHICH THE LAW ALLOWS, THE DEMANDS FOR STATION
AND TERMINAL SERVICES THAT ARE RENDERED
WITHOUT ANY OR WITHOUT ADEQUATE COMPENSATION
AND THE UNJUST DISCRIMINATION AGAINST COMPARTMENT
CARS USED AS RAILWAY POST OFFICES ARE ALL
ABUSES, SERIOUSLY INJURIOUS TO THE RAILWAYS, WHICH
HAVE GROWN UP UNDER THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF PAYMENT
AND OUGHT AT ONCE TO BE REMEDIED.</h2>


<p>In addition to the inadequacies in the rates of pay provided under
the present law, which result in payments that do not leave any balance
for taxes or return upon property and indeed do not even meet operating
expenses, there are certain conditions which have grown up in
the application of the existing basis of pay that ought to be rectified.
This is especially necessary in view of the tendency, herein shown, of
the Post Office Department to apply the system so as to reduce its expense
for railway transportation, and to look to this item as the chief
or sole source of economies.</p>

<p>The transportation pay received for each railway route is determined,
under the practice of the Department, for a period of four years
on the basis of the average daily weight carried during a period of
about three months duration prior to the beginning of the period for
which it is fixed. Thus, by the terms of the law, the Government upholds
the principle that weight should be the basis of payment but, by
an inconsistent practice, denies that principle and creates a condition
under which it is practically certain that the weight actually carried
will differ materially from the weight paid for. Congress, surely, never
intended this result for the provision of law is, merely, that the mail
shall be weighed "not less frequently" than once in four years and clearly
implies an intention that it should be weighed whenever a substantial
change in volume has taken place. But the Post Office Department
controls, subject to the provision of law, the frequency of the weighings,
and naturally seeks those reductions in its expenses which can be effected
without loss anywhere except in railway revenues. Consequently, it long
ago ceased to order new weighings, except when compelled to do so by
the expiration of the statutory limit. It thus happens that while the
railways are paid on the basis of a certain average daily weight they are
frequently carrying a much greater weight and with no compensation
whatever for the increase in the weight. In other instances the change
is in the opposite direction but with increasing national population and
wealth it is obvious that most of these changes must be to the injury
of the railways. However, the element of uncertainty thus introduced
into each contract is unbusinesslike and in fairness to both parties ought
to be removed. No railway would make a four years' contract to carry,
for a definite sum, the unlimited output of any manufacturing plant
and if it attempted to do so the contract would be void under the Interstate
Commerce law. The terms of the mail contracts are substantially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
dictated by the Postmaster-General and by Congress and the latter
ought, in justice both to the railways and to the Government, to require
the former to make annual weighings in order that the scheme of payment
provided in the law may be fairly and accurately applied.</p>

<p>Railways are required to transfer the mails between their stations
and all post offices not more than a quarter of a mile distant from the
former and, at the election of the Post Office Department, to make
similar transfers at terminals. For the former no compensation is
accorded, and for the latter the allowances are inadequate. There are
numerous instances in which these extra services require expenditures,
on the part of the railways concerned, that exceed the total compensation
of the mail routes on which they occur. The extent of these requirements
in particular cases is largely subject to the will of the Department
and this produces unreasonable uncertainties as to what may be demanded
during the life of any contract. The basis of payment plainly
does not contemplate such services, they are a survival from the period
when the mails were carried by stage-coaches, which could readily
deviate these distances from their ordinary routes, and it is clear that
the Government ought to perform these services itself or reasonably
compensate the railways therefor.</p>

<p>Much of the mail moved by the railways is carried in cars especially
equipped as traveling post offices in order that it may be accompanied by
postal clerks who perform, on the journey, precisely the labor which
they would otherwise perform in local post offices. Cars so used can be
but lightly loaded and are costly to supply, to equip, to maintain and to
move. Their use has greatly increased the efficiency of the postal service
and vastly expedited the handling of the mails. In the infancy of this
service Congress provided for additional payments for the full cars so
required, but when the practice of requiring portions of cars for the
same identical purpose was inaugurated no provision for paying for
them was made and this condition never has been corrected. Even in
Document No. 105, the injustice of this situation is recognized (page
3) and the Postmaster-General asserts that it is a purely arbitrary
discrimination and without logical basis. Obviously a reasonable allowance
for apartment cars ought to be made.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>XI. THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S PROPOSED PLAN
OF PAYMENT BASED UPON OPERATING COST AND TAXES,
TO BE ASCERTAINED BY THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT,
PLUS SIX PER CENT. IS SERIOUSLY WRONG IN PRINCIPLE
AND WOULD ENCOURAGE AND PERPETUATE INJUSTICE.</h2>


<p>The foregoing discussion makes plain the error and injustice in the
Postmaster-General's proposal to pay the railways for carrying the mail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
upon the basis of returning to them the operating expenses and taxes,
as ascertained by the Post Office Department, attributable to the carriage
of the mails, plus six per cent. of the sum of these expenses and
taxes.</p>

<p>The discussion under heading III above demonstrates that the plan
leaves out of consideration any allowance for return upon the property
and would be destructive of the universally recognized rights of the
railroad companies.</p>

<p>Furthermore, such a plan is fundamentally erroneous because it
involves paying the highest rates to the railroad that by reason of
physical disabilities or inefficient methods is most expensively operated
and the lowest rates to the railroad which, by reason of the highest
efficiency, operates at the lowest cost. A railroad's superior operating
efficiency is frequently due to exceptionally heavy capital expenditures
to obtain low grades, two, three or four main tracks, and to improve in
other respects the roadbed and tracks to the end that trains may be
hauled at the lowest expense. Such a railroad needs, and is entitled
to sufficient net earnings to enable it to pay a proper return upon the
increased value which is due to such expenditures. But under the Postmaster-General's
plan, a railroad would be penalized for all the capital
expenditures made by it for the purpose of decreasing its operating cost,
because the more it decreased its operating cost the more it would decrease
its mail pay.</p>

<p>The ascertainment of the cost to a railroad of conducting mail
service is necessarily very largely a matter of judgment and opinion,
because a large proportion of the total operating expenses are common
to the freight and passenger traffic and can only be approximately
apportioned. There is room for a very wide discretion in the
making of such apportionments. It would not be right or proper to
entrust the Post Office Department with the discretion of making such
apportionment, because the Post Office Department has an obvious interest
at stake, its object always being to reduce the railroad pay to
a minimum.</p>

<p>The last preceding statement is fully justified by the facts disclosed
by the foregoing pages, which show how consistently the Post Office
Department has relied upon reductions in railway mail pay as the ever
available source of desired curtailments of expenses and how unsuccessfully
the railways have resisted this persistent pressure. They show
that successive Postmasters-General have taken advantage of every legal
possibility, such as taking the longest time between mail weighings
which the law permits and the strained interpretation of the statute
fixing the basis of payment (<a href="#Page_19">page 19</a>), in order to effect reductions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
in railway mail pay. Consequently, the facts point irresistibly to one
conclusion, namely, that the Post Office Department is a bureaucratic
entity with an interest in the reduction of the amounts paid to the railways
that is incompatible with an impartial ascertainment of what is
fair compensation. This interest, coupled with the brief tenure of the
responsible officers of the Department, must always incline the latter to
support insufficient standards of mail pay and prevent their recognizing
the ultimate necessity of paying fairly for efficient service. It would,
therefore, be clearly inexpedient and strikingly unjust to place railway
mail revenues wholly at the mercy of the Department by enacting a law
which would authorize each Postmaster-General to fix railway mail pay
on the basis of his own inquiries and opinions in a field in which so much
must be left to estimate and approximation as that of the relative or
actual cost of the different kinds of railway service.</p>

<p>It is conceded that every railway mail contract is between the
Government, which is the sovereign, and a citizen, and that the nature
and terms of the contract are always substantially to be dictated by the
former. But this very condition invokes the principle of primary justice,
that the sovereign shall take care to exercise its power without oppression.
To this end the determination of the terms on which the Post
Office Department may have the essential services of the railways ought
to be reserved, as at least partially in the past, to the Congress, or, if
delegated at all, they should be entrusted to some bureau or agency
of Government not directly and immediately interested in reducing
railway mail pay below a just and reasonable compensation.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX A.<br />
EXTRACTS FROM THE POSTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.</h2>


<p>"Railroad companies, at stations where transfer clerks are employed,
will provide suitable and sufficient rooms for handling and
storing the mails, and without specific charge therefor. These rooms
will be lighted, heated, furnished, supplied with ice water, and kept in
order by the railroad company." Section 1186, second paragraph.</p>

<p>"The specific requirements of the service as to ... space
required ... at stations, fixtures, furniture, etc., will at all times
be determined by the Post Office Department and made known through
the General Superintendent of Railway Mail Service." Section 1186,
third paragraph.</p>

<p>"Railroad companies will require their employees who handle the
mails to keep a record of all pouches due to be received or dispatched
by them, and to check the pouches at the time they are received or dispatched,
except that no record need be kept of a single pouch from a
train or station to the post office or from the post office to a train or
station which, in regular course, is the only pouch in the custody of the
company's employees at that point while it is being handled by them.
This is not to be construed as relieving railroad companies from having
employees on trains keep and properly check a record of all closed pouches
handled by them, without exception." Section 1187, first paragraph.</p>

<p>"In case of failure to receive any pouch due, a shortage slip should
be made out, explaining cause of failure, and forwarded in lieu of the
missing pouch. Specific instructions in regard to the use of shortage
slips will be given by the General Superintendent of Railway Mail Service."
Section 1187, second paragraph.</p>

<p>"Every irregularity in the receipt and dispatch of mail should be
reported by the employee to his superintendent promptly, and if a
probable loss of or damage to mail is involved, or if the cause of failure
to receive a pouch is not known, the report should be made by wire, and
the superintendent will notify the division superintendent of Railway
Mail Service without delay. A copy of the employee's report should be
attached to and become a part of the permanent pouch record." Section
1187, third paragraph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Train pouch records will be kept on file at the headquarters of
division superintendents of railroad companies for at least one year immediately
following the date the mail covered by them was handled, and
shall be accessible there to post office inspectors and other agents of the
Post Office Department. Station pouch records will be kept on file at the
station to which they apply for at least one year immediately following
the date the mail covered by them was handled, and shall be accessible
there to post office inspectors and other agents of the Post Office Department."
Section 1187, fourth paragraph.</p>

<p>"Railroad companies will require their employees to submit pouch
records for examination to post office inspectors and other duly accredited
agents of the Post Office Department upon their request and exhibition
of credentials to such employees." Section 1187, fifth paragraph.</p>

<p>"Every railroad company is required to take the mails from, and
deliver them into, all terminal post offices, whatever may be the distance
between the station and post office, except in cities where other provision
for such service is made by the Post Office Department. In all cases
where the Department has not made other provision, the distance between
terminal post office and nearest station is computed in, and paid for,
as part of the route." Section 1191, first paragraph.</p>

<p>"The railroad company must also take the mails from and deliver
them into all intermediate post offices and postal stations located not
more than eighty rods from the nearest railroad station at which the
company has an agent or other representative employed, and the company
shall not be relieved of such duty on account of the discontinuance
of an agency without thirty days' notice to the Department." Section
1191, second paragraph.</p>

<p>"At connecting points where railroad stations are not over eighty
rods apart a company having mails on its train to be forwarded by the
connecting train will be required to transfer such mails and deliver
them into the connecting train, or, if the connection is not immediate, to
deliver them to the agent of the company to be properly dispatched by
the trains of said company." Section 1192.</p>

<p>"At places where railroad companies are required to take the mails
from and deliver them into post offices or postal stations or to transfer
them to connecting railroads, the persons employed to perform such
service are agents of the companies and not employees of the postal service,
and need not be sworn; but such persons must be more than sixteen
years old and of suitable intelligence and character. Postmasters will
promptly report any violation of this requirement." Section 1193.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where it is desirable to have mails taken from the post office or
postal station to train at a terminal point where the terminal service devolves
upon the company, in advance of the regular time of closing mails,
the company will be required to make such advance delivery as becomes
necessary by the requirements of the service." Section 1194.</p>

<p>"When a messenger employed by the Post Office Department cannot
wait for a delayed train without missing other mails the railroad company
will be required to take charge of and dispatch the mails for the
delayed train, and will be responsible for the inward mail until delivered
to the messenger or other authorized representative of the Department."
Section 1195.</p>

<p>"Whenever the mail on any railroad route arrives at a late hour of
the night the railroad company must retain custody thereof by placing
the same in a secure and safe room or apartment of the depot or station
until the following morning, when it must be delivered at the post office,
or to the mail messenger employed by the Post Office Department, at
as early an hour as the necessities of the post office may require." Section
1196.</p>

<p>"When a train departs from a railroad station in the night time
later than 9 o'clock, and it is deemed necessary to have the mail dispatched
by such train, the division superintendent of Railway Mail
Service will, where mail is taken from and delivered into the post office
by the railroad company, request the company, or where a mail messenger
or carrier is employed by the Post Office Department, will direct him,
to take the mail to the railroad station at such time as will best serve
the interest of the mail service. Such mail will be taken charge of by
the agent or other representative of the railroad company, who will
be required to keep it in some secure place until the train arrives, and
then see that it is properly dispatched." Section 1197, first paragraph.</p>

<p>"The division superintendent of Railway Mail Service will give
reasonable advance notice to the proper officer of the railroad company,
in order that the agent or representatives of the company may be properly
instructed." Section 1197, second paragraph.</p>

<p>"Railroad companies will be expected to place their mail cars at
points accessible to mail messengers or contractors for wagon service.
If cars are not so placed the companies will be required to receive the
mails from and deliver them to the messengers or contractors at points
accessible to the wagon of the messenger or contractor." Section 1198.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"A mail train must not pull out and leave mails which are in
process of being loaded on the car or which the conductor or trainman
has information are being trucked from wagons or some part of the
station to the cars." Section 1199.</p>

<p>"At all points at which trains do not stop where the Post Office
Department deems the exchange of mails necessary, a device for the receipt
and delivery of mails satisfactory to the Department must be
erected and maintained; and pending the erection of such device the
speed of trains must be slackened so as to permit the exchange to be
made with safety." Section 1200, first paragraph.</p>

<p>"In all cases where the Department deems it necessary to the safe
exchange of the mails the railroad company will be required to reduce
the speed or stop the train." Section 1200, second paragraph.</p>

<p>"When night mails are caught from a crane the railroad company
must furnish the lantern or light to be attached to the crane and keep
the same in proper condition, regularly placed and lighted; but if the
company has no agent or employee at such station, the company must
furnish the light, and the care and placing of same will devolve upon
the Department's carrier." Section 1200, third paragraph.</p>

<p>"The engineer of a train shall give timely notice, by whistle or other
signal, of its approach to a mail crane." Section 1200, fourth paragraph.</p>

<p>"Railroad companies are required to convey upon any train, without
specific charge therefor, all mail bags, post office blanks, stationery,
supplies, and all duly accredited agents of the Post Office Department

<h2>APPENDIX D.<br />

HOW RAILWAY WAGES HAVE INCREASED.</h2>


<p>In the year 1901 the railways reporting to the Interstate Commerce
Commission received, in gross from operating sources, the sum of
$1,588,526,037.00 and expended in wages and salaries the sum of $610,713,701.00;
in 1910 the corresponding totals were $2,750,667,435.00 and
$1,143,725,306.00. Computations from these totals show that in 1901
the railways expended in wages and salaries $38.45 out of each $100.00
of gross operating receipts, while in 1910 the proportion had increased
to $41.58 a difference of $3.13 in each $100.00 of gross receipts. This
difference does not seem small but it is hardly realized, except when the
calculation is made, that on the basis of the gross receipts of 1910 it
would amount, as it does, to an additional expense of $86,095,890.72. It
is to be borne in mind that this largely increased payment to labor is in
spite of the fact that a part of the increase in wage rates has been
offset by higher efficiency in method and facilities. Comparisons of
rates of wages, from the annual statistical reports of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, follow:</p>

<p>My dear Sir:</p>

<p>I hand you herewith a copy of Senate Bill No. 7371, introduced by
me by direction of the Senate Committee on Post Offices and Post
Roads, embodying a plan recommended by the Post Office Department
for determining the compensation to be paid to railroad companies for
transportation of the mails. This general subject has been referred to
a joint Committee of Congress. The Committee has not yet organized
and probably will not do so for several weeks, but as a member of that
Committee and as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Post Offices
and Post Roads and under authority of Senate Resolution No. 56, I desire
to secure immediately such information as may be available for
submission to the Committee at its first meeting. I will ask you, therefore,
to answer the following questions:</p>

<p>(1) Do you deem the present plan of compensation an equitable
one as between the Government and the railroads? If not, in what respects
and as to what classes of railroads is it inequitable?</p>

<p>(2) Is the underlying principle of the plan embodied in the inclosed
bill a proper basis for compensation? If not, wherein is it
improper, and why?</p>

<p>(3) What, in your opinion, is a desirable plan for compensating
railroad companies for transporting the mails?</p>

<p>I desire an early reply to these inquiries relating to the general plan,
and, if you are not ready to do so now, shall be glad to have you submit
later a detailed discussion of this bill and of House Document No. 105,
62d Congress, 1st Session, with which, I assume, you are familiar.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX G.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Committee on Railway Mail Pay.</span></p>


<p class="right">October 3, 1912.</p>

<p>Hon. Jonathan Bourne, Jr.,<br />

<span style="margin-left:2em;">Chairman, Senate Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left:4em;">Washington, D. C.</span></p>

<p>My dear Sir:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Committee on Railway Mail Pay, representing 268 roads operating
over 214,275 miles of road, has been investigating the subject of
mail compensation for about three years, or since the Post Office Department,
in 1909, sent out a series of questions regarding the space furnished
for mails in passenger trains, and the cost to railroad companies
of the service which they perform for the Government in the carriage
of the mails. Therefore the Committee has thought it would be of interest
to you to receive from it an answer to the questions propounded
by your letter of September 11, 1912, addressed to the officers of railroads
throughout the country.</p>

<p>A response to House Document No. 105 is now in course of preparation,
and will be submitted at an early date. In the meantime, our
committee desires to submit the following replies to your inquiries:</p>

<p><i>Question 1.</i>&mdash;Do you deem the present plan of compensation an
equitable one as between the Government and the railroads? If not,
in what respects and as to what classes of railroads is it inequitable?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;The existing law has never worked to the disadvantage of
the Government, but has failed to do justice to the railways by reason
of infrequent weighing; absence of pay for nearly 40 per cent. of the
space occupied as travelling post offices; the performance, without pay,
of side and terminal messenger service, and the unjustifiable reduction
in pay by the Act of Congress dated March 2, 1907, supplemented by
Order No. 412 of the Postmaster General, changing the divisor.</p>

<p>The present law is based upon correct principles, but should be so
amended as to provide&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>(a) For the Repeal of the Act of March 2, 1907.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the large increase in every other item connected
with the administration of the Post Office Department, the
railroads' pay has been singled out as the one element in these operations
for concentration of economies. This too, in the face of
the fact that the operating expenses of the railroads have been
greatly augmented by the requirements of the law with reference to
steel equipment, and a general increase in cost characteristic of all
business operations.</p>

<p>(b) For annual weighings, and a definite and just method for
ascertaining daily average weights.</p>

<p>Under the quadrennial weighing all increased weight of mail
during the next succeeding four years is carried by the railroads
without any compensation whatever, which is manifestly unfair.</p>

<p>The railroads must provide car space and facilities for the <i>maximum</i>
weight offered at <i>any</i> time, yet they are paid only for the
<i>average</i> weight carried. The Postmaster General's order covering
the divisor has unfairly reduced this <i>average</i>.</p>

<p>This provision is essentially necessary in view of the bill establishing
the Parcels Post, effective January 1, 1913, which will result
in taking from the express service traffic for which the railroad
companies now receive compensation and transferring it to the mail
service; the bill referred to containing no provision for payment to
the railroad companies for the increased tonnage to be handled in
mail cars, although such provision was made for the star routes and
the city wagon service.</p>

<p>(c) For pay for Apartment Cars on some basis that will compensate
for the service.</p>

<p>That the Postmaster General has himself recognized the justice
of such a change, is indicated in the following quotation from page
3 of House Document No. 105:&mdash;</p>

<p>"* * * an additional amount may be allowed for railway
post office cars when the space for distribution purposes occupies 40
feet or more of the car length. No additional compensation is
allowed for space for distribution purposes occupying less than 40
feet of the car length. This distinction is a purely arbitrary one
and without any logical reason for its existence."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>(d) For a fair allowance to the railroads for the side and
terminal messenger service which they perform for the Post Office
Department, according to the value of this service to the Post Office
Department.</p>

<p>The necessity for this is also emphasized by the establishment of
the Parcels Post which will undoubtedly add greatly to the expense
of the service.</p>

<p>(e) That all rates of pay should be definite and not subject
to the discretion of the officers of the Post Office Department.</p>

<p>Other inequities exist under the present law, but are due to the
administrative methods rather than to the law itself.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Question 2.</i>&mdash;Is the underlying principle of the plan embodied in
the enclosed bill a proper basis for compensation? If not, wherein is it
improper, and why?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;The underlying principle of the plan embodied in Senate
Bill No. 7371 is not correct. Any plan of compensation based upon
operating cost and taxes, plus six per cent. for profit, is fundamentally
wrong, because it makes no allowance for return upon the property
employed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, such plan is not correct, because it involves paying the
highest rates to the railroad that by reason of physical disabilities or
inefficient methods is most expensively operated, and the lowest rates
to the railroad whose operations are most efficient and whose service is
most satisfactory and valuable to the Post Office Department. Under
the plan proposed, a railroad would be penalized for all the capital expenditures
made by it for the purpose of decreasing its operating cost,
because the more it decreased its operating cost the more it would decrease
its mail pay, although by making this improvement in operating
cost it would have incurred an additional capital charge upon which
it would have to pay dividends or interest.</p>

<p>The ascertainment of the cost to a railroad of conducting the mail
service is necessarily very largely a matter of judgment and opinion,
because a large proportion of the total operating expenses are expenses
common to the freight and passenger traffic and can only be approximately
apportioned and there are various formulas existing for such
apportionment. It would not be right or proper to entrust to the Post
Office Department the discretion of selecting the formulas by which to
ascertain these costs, because the Post Office Department has an obvious
interest at stake, its object always being to reduce the railroad pay to a
minimum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p>The estimated cost of a specific service is not a proper basis for fixing
rates for transportation of any commodity. The railroads are entitled
to receive a full and fair return for the value of the service performed,
and the ascertainment of cost of such service is principally of value as
a protection against the establishment of confiscatory rates.</p>

<p><i>Question 3.</i>&mdash;What, in your opinion, is a desirable plan for compensating
railroad companies for transporting the mails?</p>

<p><i>Answer</i>.&mdash;The existing law has been in effect for nearly forty years,
and those who have worked under it are more or less familiar with its
operations. If it were amended to correct serious inequities, as suggested
in the answer to Question 1, and fairly and impartially administered
by the Post Office Department, it would be preferable to any
untried or theoretical plan that could be proposed.</p>

is commonly admitted. The public constantly demands greater comfort
and convenience which can be supplied only by improvements in property and
equipment that bring in no additional income. A present example in the mail
service, itself, is the great expense which the railways are now undergoing in
substituting steel mail cars for those formerly in use. The old cars, which
thus become a total loss were fully up to the most advanced standards of construction
when built and they could continue for a long time to serve the
purposes of the service except for the public demand for stronger cars.</p></div>

(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
